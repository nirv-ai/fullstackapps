## When opinions clash

> the hardest part in making a choice, is figuring out who to blame when things go wrong. _Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming_

- i tend to focus on openminded frameworks and libraries vs the opinionated toolset or kitchen sink
- big fan of the [unix philisophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
  - Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
  - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
  - Write programs to work together.
  - Interactive use instead of batch processing.
  - Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints ("salvation through suffering").
  - Self-supporting system: all software is built with _nimlang and js_
